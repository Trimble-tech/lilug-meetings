# LILUG Meetings Repository  
This is a place to keep meeting notes for the Long Island Linux User Group.

# Contributions
1. Each month will have a meeting notes file uploaded, typically by the secretary. 
2. If you have additions, please edit the month's markdown file and contribute.
3. Keep contributions civil and ask us for questions.
4. Usage of draft branch or alternative branches are appreciated for staging changes.
5. Read the **Format** section of this document to understand project workflow.

## Format
This repository has established the following workflow:
1. Write notes in Markdown.
2. Add copy coverted to PDF for additional portability.
3. Check it against template and ensure no format issues prevent readibility.
4. Ensure notes are accurate and information contained is okay to be public.
5. Commit to *drafts* branch and create pull request when finalized.

- To convert to PDF, I am using this VSCodium extension: <https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf>. However, feel free to use something else as long as it is easy to read and has no licensing issues. Adobe software should not be required, the file must open in something freely available like Firefox or Chromium.
- If content discrepanies exist between markdown and PDF, the markdown should be trusted as the "source of truth" until the PDF is rectified.
