## Main Discussion: Managing MSPs by Joe Rojas

### Getting Started in IT & Tech (how Joe Rojas got started)
- Unix Experience from US Army
- Experience with Managed Service Provider IT since 1990's

### Critical Questions to Ask When Starting MSP Business
1. What is the *business* problem that I want to solve?
    - There should be common problems that start appearing across clients.
    - Problems can and should be presented to clients in their own words to make it relatable.
2. How can the businesses/clients make money with the solutions implemented? (You are a partner and not an employee)
3. What technology solutions shall be implemented?

### Finding Focus in MSPs (1)
- Initially had "no focus", so it was hard to make money; focus on one type of client helps growth & management
- First went with Personal Injury Lawyers, then Architects
- Finding Focus in the MSP is the first step toward making a better business

### Put it in Their Words (2)
**Meet with the client to find how technology can solve their problems.**
- Have an agenda
- Show objectives of the client
- Since the last meeting, what has gone well and what is a problem?
- What are you confident in and what is missing?
- What are you excited about, and what are you worried about?
- What are five things that must happen in your business for you to feel more pride, confidence, and excitement?

### Show The Value of Your Technology (3)
- What you think is expensive may not be expensive for the client.
- Word possible technology solutions in a way that is directly connected to the company mission.
- If the technology helps save the business money, it can pay for itself.
- "If you can give them 3 or 4 dollars for each one they spend (the client) will be happy." -- Joe Rojas
