## Main Discussion: Linux Security by Chris Trimble
For slide deck, refer to attached file "Linux Security Presentation.odp."

- Security Posture varies based on use case
- General practices like firewalls, updates, and (controlled) automation help mitigate risks
- Advanced use cases require advanced security but simple ones are typically better off with simpler plans
    - If the practices are too difficult to be followed routinely then the security is hypothetical at best
- Have backups
- Have a "Business Continuity Plan"
- Review logs and don't place too much trust in one software or solution; be aware of possible attack vectors.

## Take-Away
There are a lot of security softwares and solutions but the main thing to remember is to have a plan to mitigate risk and a plan for when things go wrong. Have practices that you follow regularly and understand, and make sure that you can readily replicate them if your Linux install fails. Be prepared to spend more time on security as your software needs advance or grow. Lastly, security via obscurity is dead; secure every system as if the whole internet can see and attack it.
